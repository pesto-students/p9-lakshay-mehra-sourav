## [](#about-the-app)About The App

---

This is a weather API based on Open Weather API. It provides 3 endpoints:

- **/api/weather**: Retrieves weather data of multiple cities, supporting filtering by city name or city code, and pagination.
- **/api/forecast**: Provides a detailed forecast for the next X days, allowing filtering by city, date, and moment.
- **/api/current**: Retrieves the current weather conditions of a particular city.

I mainly used `NodeJS` here along with the `Express` framework.

## [](#setup)Setup

---

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm run start` or `npm run dev`

## [](#approach)Approach

---

I used the OpenWeatherMap API here to get the actual weather results based on the query data provided by the user through the API interface and then return the data as it's received from OpenWeatherMap's API.
